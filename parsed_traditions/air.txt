The wind imposes 3 banes on ranged weapon attacks made against targets in or behind the area; siege weapons and firearms ignore this effect.

While you are underwater, the wind provides you with air so you can breathe normally. When you land after a fall, the winds cushion you so that you take half damage.

You can cast this spell even if you haven’t learned it. Sustained Winds You can use an action to create a sustained blast of wind that lasts for as long as you concentrate, up until the spell ends. The wind spreads across a 10-yard-wide and 30-yard-long line in a direction you choose. In the area, the wind disperses all vapors, gases, smoke, and fog, extinguishes all unprotected flames, and scatters lightweight unsecured objects such as papers and pebbles. Creatures moving against the wind treat the area as difficult terrain. The wind is strong enough the fill the sails of a sailing ship. Uplifting Wind When you would move, you can use a triggered action to call on the winds to lift you, enabling you to move by flying until the end of the round. If you do not land on a solid surface by the time this effect ends, you fall. When you would jump, you can use a triggered action to call the winds to aid you. For 1 round, you treat your Agility score as if it were 5 higher for the purpose of determining the distance you can jump (Shadow, page 47), and you make challenge rolls to jump with 3 boons.

In addition, each living and breathing creature in the area must get a success on a Strength challenge roll with 1 bane or take 3d6 damage and become dazed for 1 round. At the end of the round in which you cast this spell, air within 10 yards of the area rushes in to fill the vacuum, moving vapors, fog, smoke, and gas into the area. In addition, the sudden wind extinguishes all flames within 10 yards of the area and pulls all Size 2 and smaller unsecured objects into the area of vacuum. Each creature within 10 yards of the area makes Strength challenge rolls with 2 banes. Flying creatures make the roll with 4 banes. For each point of Size above 2, a creature makes the roll with 1 boon. On a failure, the creature takes 2d6 damage, moves 1d6 + 1 yards toward the origin point, and then falls prone. On a success, a creature just takes half the damage.

A Size 2 or larger creature makes the roll with 1 boon plus 1 boon per point of Size it has above 2. If a target’s roll is a failure, you launch the target 5d6 + 20 yards into the sky. When it reaches this distance, it then falls, taking damage as normal upon landing (Shadow, page 38). If a creature can fly, it does not fall unless it can’t move. A target that encounters a solid surface before traveling the full distance of the fall takes 1d6 damage plus 1d6 damage for each 5 full yards it was prevented from moving. After taking this damage, the target falls.

**Duration** Concentration, up to 1 hour

You and everything you wear and carry assume the form of a Size 3 howling whirlwind, gaining all of the following traits. When the spell ends, you and everything you wear and carry return to your normal form, appearing anywhere in the space you formerly occupied as a whirlwind. Sightless You rely on senses other than sight to perceive your surroundings and can pinpoint the location of each creature and object within long range of you. Creatures within that area cannot hide from you, and you ignore banes imposed by obscurement on rolls to perceive things. You are not subject to the blinded condition. Swift as the Wind You gain a +10 bonus to Speed, and you can fly. Immune damage from disease and poison; blinded, dazed, deafened, diseased, fatigued, frightened, immobilized, poisoned, prone, slowed, and stunned. Resilience You take half damage from weapons.

+++ FURY OF THE HEAVENS 
//AIR ATTACK 10// 
----
**Target** A point on the ground that you can see within extreme range that is under the sky
**Duration** Concentration, up to 1 minute
An enormous tornado appears in the sky and descends until it touches the target. The tornado is 200 yards in diameter where it touches the ground and forms a funnel that’s up to 1d6 × 100 yards tall. At the end of each round, the tornado moves 50 yards in a straight line in a direction you choose. For the duration, anything in the tornado’s space or that enters it takes 8d6 damage. A creature or an object can take this damage only once per round, regardless of how many times it enters the tornado. When a creature takes this damage, it must make a Strength challenge roll with 1 bane, or 3 banes if the creature is flying. On a failure, the creature is grabbed by the tornado. The tornado has an effective Strength of 20. Unsecured items are automatically pulled into the tornado’s space. Objects, such as structures and trees, destroyed by the tornado’s damage are also pulled into the tornado’s space. When the spell ends, all the debris inside the tornado falls to the ground, turning the ground in its space and within 200 yards of it into difficult terrain until it’s cleared away. Any creatures in the tornado fall 10d6 yards to the ground.
**Aftereffect** You must make a Will challenge roll with 5 banes. On a failure, 1d6 + 3 hostile wind genies appear in spaces the GM chooses within 10 yards of you. The genies take the next available turn to attack you and your companions, fighting to the death.
